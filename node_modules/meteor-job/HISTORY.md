#### 1.3.1

* Don't automatically set the default value of the `repeatId` option to `job.done()` to maintain compatibility with older servers.

#### 1.3.0

* Added ability for workers to specify a timeout for running jobs, so that if they crash or lose connectivity the job can fail and be restarted. Providing a falsy value of option `pollInterval` when calling `Job.processJobs()` will now disable polling in favor of using `q.trigger` exclusively.
* Fixed bug where `q.trigger()` caused a `getWork()` call, even when the queue is paused.
* Added `repeatId` option to `job.done()` which when `true` will cause the successful return value of a repeating job to be the `_id` of the newly scheduled job.
* Added new methods `job.ready()` and `jc.readyJobs()` to move jobs from waiting to ready.

#### 1.2.0

* Added optional `collectionName` parameter to `setDDP`, enabling multiple DDP connections to be used by providing a mapping between collection names and connections.
* Bumped npm deps

#### 1.1.1

* Fixed bug that could cause JobQueue to grab more jobs than configured when `q.trigger()` or very short pollIntervals are used.
* Bumped npm deps

* Deprecated Job.makeJob(root, doc) in favor of "new Job(root, doc)" constructor signature.
* Added value getters for job.doc, job.type and job.data.
* Added `jq.trigger()` method to provide a mechanism to trigger `getWork` using an alternative method to `pollInterval`
* j.refresh() is now chainable
* Added Fiber support for non-Meteor node.js clients. See `Job.setDDP(ddp, [Fiber])`
* Job constructor now supports supplying an object for `root` if that object has a string attribute named `root`.
